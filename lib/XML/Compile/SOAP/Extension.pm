=chapter NAME
XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension - plugins for standards

=chapter SYNOPSIS
 # only as base-class

=chapter DESCRIPTION
This module defines hooks which are used to implement the SOAP and
WSDL extensions. Hooks are created on critial spots, where additional
standards play tricks with the logic of SOAP and WSDL. There are a
lot of those standards, for instance Web Service Addressing (WSA,
M<XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA>)

Do not use this hook for adding WSDLs or schemas, unless those are
used to interpret $wsdl or SOAP files correctly.

### For all methods named below: when called on an object, it is the stub

### extension objects.
